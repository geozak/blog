# Geozak's Blog

I am a student in computer systems engineering. Whenever I have to a research to solve a problem I generally write up a little guide of the results. However, I never do anything with these guides and usually end up loosing them before needing them again. So I started this blog to share those guides for others and my futrue needs.
