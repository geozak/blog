Geozak's Blog
============

This is my blog. It uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator along with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme, I [customized](https://github.com/geozak/jekyll-clean-dark) from streetturtle's [Jekyll Clean Dark](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark) and scotte's [Jekyll Clean](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean) themes.
